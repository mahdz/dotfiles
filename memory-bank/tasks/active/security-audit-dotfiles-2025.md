# Security Audit: Dotfiles Repository - 2025

**Date:** 2025-01-21  
**Status:** Action Required  
**Priority:** HIGH (Critical security issue identified)

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive security audit performed on dotfiles repository (161 tracked files). Overall security posture is mature with well-architected tooling, but one critical vulnerability requires immediate attention.

## Critical Findings

### üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Age Encryption Private Key Exposure**
- **Location:** `.config/mise/age.txt`
- **Risk:** CRITICAL - Private key stored in plaintext in version control
- **Impact:** Anyone with repository access can decrypt all SOPS-encrypted secrets
- **Status:** Unresolved

## Security Assessment Results

### ‚úÖ Good Practices Identified

1. **External Secret Management**
   - Pixiv refresh token correctly externalized in `gallery-dl` config
   - Secrets stored in `~/.local/share/secrets/` (outside version control)
   - Shell configs conditionally source external secret files
   - Scripts use environment variable checks (e.g., `ai-commit-msg.sh`)

2. **Comprehensive Gitignore Protection**
   - Deny-all pattern with explicit whitelisting
   - Excludes secrets, environment files, and sensitive patterns
   - Protects `.config/` and `memory-bank/` directories

3. **Mature Security Tooling**
   - **`ks`**: Lightweight macOS Keychain CLI manager
   - **`pw`**: Terminal password manager with GPG/KeePassXC plugins
   - **Secretive**: Secure Enclave-backed SSH key management
   - **macOS Keychain**: Hardware-integrated credential storage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate Concerns

1. **Environment Variable References**
   - Some scripts reference env var names directly (acceptable practice)
   - No inline secrets detected in codebase
   - Path references like `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` pose minimal risk

## Recommendations

### 1. Critical Security Actions

- [ ] **Generate new Age key pair** (store securely outside version control)
- [ ] **Re-encrypt all SOPS secrets** with new Age key
- [ ] **Remove old private key from git history** using `git-filter-repo`
- [ ] **Add age key patterns to `.gitignore`**

### 2. Security Improvements

- [ ] **Standardize secret management strategy**
  - Document preferred tool hierarchy
  - Create migration plan if needed
- [ ] **Extend `.gitignore` patterns**
  - Add private key exclusions
  - Include credential file patterns
- [ ] **Document environment variables**
  - Create `~/memory-bank/secrets-inventory.md`
  - List required secrets: `PIXIV_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.

### 3. Ongoing Security Practices

- [ ] **Implement regular security audits**
- [ ] **Set up pre-commit hooks** for secret detection
- [ ] **Create incident response plan** for credential exposure

## Tool Analysis

### Current Password Management Infrastructure

| Tool | Purpose | Integration | Security Level |
|------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `ks` | macOS Keychain CLI | Native | Hardware-backed |
| `pw` | Terminal password manager | GPG/KeePassXC | Plugin-based |
| Secretive | SSH key management | Secure Enclave | Hardware-backed |
| macOS Keychain | System credential store | Native | Hardware-backed |

### Pass Integration Assessment

**Current State:** Sophisticated, integrated, hardware-backed infrastructure  
**Pass Benefits:** Git integration, scriptability, cross-platform portability  
**Recommendation:** Optional addition rather than replacement

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Security (URGENT)
1. Rotate Age encryption keys
2. Clean git history
3. Update SOPS configuration
4. Verify all encrypted secrets work with new key

### Phase 2: Documentation & Standardization
1. Create secrets inventory
2. Document security procedures
3. Update `.gitignore` patterns
4. Establish regular audit schedule

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Optional)
1. Evaluate Pass integration
2. Implement automated secret scanning
3. Set up security monitoring

## Files Audited

**Total Files:** 161 tracked files  
**Key Configuration Files:** `.gitignore`, `.roomodes`, shell configs, scripts  
**Security Tools:** `ks`, `pw`, SOPS configurations  
**Secret Storage:** `~/.local/share/secrets/` (external)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Address Age key exposure (ETA: 24 hours)
2. **Short-term:** Complete documentation and standardization (ETA: 1 week)
3. **Medium-term:** Implement enhanced security practices (ETA: 1 month)

## Notes

- Merge conflicts in `.gitignore` and `.roomodes` have been resolved
- Repository is ready for development post-security fixes
- Current security architecture is well-designed and mature
- Critical issue is isolated and remediable without major infrastructure changes

# Task Breakdown with Priorities

## Priority Classification System

- 🔴 **Critical**: Must be completed immediately, blocks other work
- 🟠 **High**: Important for project success, should be completed soon
- 🟡 **Medium**: Valuable but not urgent, can be scheduled flexibly
- 🟢 **Low**: Nice to have, can be deferred if needed

## Step 4: High-Priority Script Integration

### Critical Priority Tasks 🔴

#### T4.1: Audit Script Inventory
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: None
**Description**: Complete inventory of all custom scripts in `~/.local/bin/` and other locations

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] List all files in `~/.local/bin/`
- [ ] Identify UV-managed symlinks vs custom scripts
- [ ] Document script purposes and dependencies
- [ ] Classify by integration complexity

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete catalog of all scripts
- [ ] Each script categorized by purpose
- [ ] Dependencies documented
- [ ] Integration complexity assessed

#### T4.2: Backup Current Script State
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Dependencies**: T4.1
**Description**: Create backup of current script configuration before integration

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Create backup branch in dotfiles repo
- [ ] Document current script locations
- [ ] Export current PATH configuration
- [ ] Record current shell aliases and functions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Backup branch created
- [ ] Current state fully documented
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested

### High Priority Tasks 🟠

#### T4.3: Integrate Dotfiles Management Scripts
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: T4.1, T4.2
**Description**: Move and integrate dotfiles-specific automation scripts

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Identify dotfiles management utilities
- [ ] Create appropriate directory structure
- [ ] Update script paths and references
- [ ] Test dotfiles operations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All dotfiles scripts properly located
- [ ] `dot` alias functionality preserved
- [ ] Script cross-references updated
- [ ] Functionality verified through testing

#### T4.4: Integrate System Automation Scripts
**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours
**Dependencies**: T4.3
**Description**: Move system-level automation and AppleScript utilities

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Catalog system automation scripts
- [ ] Update AppleScript paths if needed
- [ ] Verify system integration points
- [ ] Test automation functionality

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] System scripts properly integrated
- [ ] AppleScript automations functional
- [ ] System integration points verified
- [ ] No regression in automation capability

### Medium Priority Tasks 🟡

#### T4.5: Update Shell Configuration
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: T4.3, T4.4
**Description**: Update shell aliases and PATH to work with integrated scripts

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Review current aliases referencing scripts
- [ ] Update PATH configurations
- [ ] Modify script cross-references
- [ ] Test shell functionality

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All aliases point to correct locations
- [ ] PATH includes necessary directories
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] Shell startup time not degraded

#### T4.6: Update Documentation
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: T4.3, T4.4, T4.5
**Description**: Document changes made during integration

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Update memory bank with script locations
- [ ] Document new directory structure
- [ ] Update usage instructions
- [ ] Record integration decisions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Memory bank updated with current state
- [ ] Script usage documented
- [ ] Integration decisions recorded
- [ ] Next steps clearly defined

### Low Priority Tasks 🟢

#### T4.7: Performance Optimization
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Dependencies**: All above tasks
**Description**: Optimize script loading and execution

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Profile shell startup time
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Benchmark improvements

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Shell startup under 500ms
- [ ] No noticeable performance degradation
- [ ] Optimization strategies documented

## Step 5: Development Tool Scripts (Future)

### Preparation Tasks

#### T5.1: Development Script Audit
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Description**: Inventory development-focused utilities and build scripts

#### T5.2: Git Workflow Integration
**Priority**: 🟠 High
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Description**: Integrate Git automation and workflow scripts

#### T5.3: Mise Utility Integration
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Description**: Integrate mise-related utilities and helpers

## Risk Assessment by Task

### High Risk Tasks
- **T4.3**: Dotfiles management scripts (could break repository operations)
- **T4.4**: System automation (could affect macOS automation)
- **T4.5**: Shell configuration (could break terminal functionality)

### Medium Risk Tasks
- **T4.1**: Script inventory (minimal risk, mostly documentation)
- **T4.6**: Documentation (no functional risk)

### Low Risk Tasks
- **T4.2**: Backup creation (protective measure)
- **T4.7**: Performance optimization (optional improvements)

## Testing Strategy

### Continuous Testing
- After each script integration: Test script functionality
- After shell updates: Test shell startup and basic operations
- After each major task: Verify dotfiles operations with `dot` alias

### Integration Testing
- Full shell restart test
- VS Code integration test
- Development workflow test
- System automation test

### Rollback Testing
- Test rollback to backup branch
- Verify restoration of previous functionality
- Document rollback time and complexity

## Timeline Estimate

**Step 4 Total Time**: 14-20 hours
**Recommended Schedule**: 
- Week 1: T4.1, T4.2, T4.3 (Critical and first High priority)
- Week 2: T4.4, T4.5 (Remaining High and Medium priority)
- Week 3: T4.6, T4.7 (Documentation and optimization)

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- [ ] All scripts accessible from expected locations
- [ ] No functionality regression detected
- [ ] Shell startup time within performance requirements
- [ ] Dotfiles operations fully functional

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] All changes committed to Git
- [ ] Documentation updated and accurate
- [ ] Integration decisions recorded
- [ ] Rollback procedure validated

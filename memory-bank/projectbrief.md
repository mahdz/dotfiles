# Dotfiles Management Project Brief

## Core Requirements

1.  Manage personal dotfiles for macOS to ensure a clean home directory.
2.  Provide version control for configurations using a bare Git repository.
3.  Streamline the setup of new machines with automation scripts.
4.  Store configurations in XDG-compliant directories (`~/.config`, `~/.local/share`, `~/.cache`).
5.  Solve the problem of cluttered home directories from scattered configuration files.
6.  Enable easy tracking of changes to configurations.

## Project Goals

1.  **Primary Goal**: To create a robust, portable, and version-controlled dotfiles management system for macOS that adheres to the XDG Base Directory Specification, keeping the `$HOME` directory clean and streamlining the setup of new systems.

2.  **Specific Objectives**:
    - Keep the home directory free of clutter by using XDG-compliant locations.
    - Track changes to configurations for easy review, rollback, and synchronization.
    - Reduce the time and effort required to set up a new machine.
    - Promote secure handling of sensitive files by excluding them from version control.

## Scope

### In Scope

1.  **Dotfiles Management**
    - Use a bare Git repository for tracking files.
    - Store configurations in XDG-compliant directories.
    - Provide scripts for easy management and bootstrapping.
2.  **Configuration**
    - Zsh configuration sourcing from `~/.config/zsh`.
    - Strategic ignoring of files using a global `.gitignore`.
    - Explicit tracking of configuration files.
3.  **Documentation**
    - Installation instructions.
    - Management scripts usage.
    - Explanation of the architecture.

### Out of Scope

1.  Non-development related software and settings.
2.  Personal data migration.
3.  System backup and restore.
4.  Hardware-specific configurations.

## Success Criteria

1.  A simple and intuitive process for adding and managing dotfiles.
2.  A fast and reliable setup on new macOS systems.
3.  A clear separation of configuration from the home directory.
4.  The system successfully manages and versions dotfiles.
5.  The setup process is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely).

## Constraints

1.  Some applications may not respect XDG directory standards.
2.  Requires the user to manually add new configuration files to the Git repository.
3.  Primarily designed for macOS, may require adjustments for other OSes.

## Technical Stack

1.  **Core Technologies**
    - Git (Bare Repository Pattern)
    - Zsh
    - Shell Scripting
    - XDG Base Directory Specification
2.  **Related Tools & Integrations**
    - Antidote (Zsh plugin manager)
    - Homebrew (Package Manager)
    - Mise (Tool Manager)

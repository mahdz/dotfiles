# Memory Bank Documentation Summary

## Overview

This memory bank contains comprehensive documentation for the dotfiles repository script integration project. The documentation captures the current state, integration plan, task breakdown, and technical decisions for systematically incorporating existing scripts into the XDG-compliant bare Git repository structure.

## Documentation Structure

### üìã Plans
- **[10-Step Integration Plan](plans/10-step-integration-plan)**: Complete roadmap for script integration with status tracking and success criteria

### üèóÔ∏è Context  
- **[Current Project State and Context](context/current-project-state-and-context)**: Comprehensive overview of the existing dotfiles architecture, tool stack, and current state assessment

### ‚úÖ Tasks
- **[Task Breakdown with Priorities](tasks/task-breakdown-with-priorities)**: Detailed task breakdown for Step 4 with priority classification, time estimates, and success metrics

### üß† Decisions
- **[Technical Decisions and Rationale](decisions/technical-decisions-and-rationale)**: Documentation of all architectural and technical decisions with rationale and trade-offs

## Key Project Information

### Current Status
- **Phase**: Step 3 Complete (Documentation Foundation)
- **Next Phase**: Step 4 (High-Priority Script Integration)
- **Repository**: Bare Git at `~/.dotfiles` with `~` as worktree
- **Architecture**: XDG Base Directory Specification compliant

### Critical Components
- **Management**: `dot` alias for dotfiles Git operations
- **Shell**: Zsh with antidote plugin manager
- **Prompt**: Starship with custom configuration  
- **Tools**: Mise for version management, UV for Python packages
- **Editor**: VS Code with extensive extension management

### Integration Approach
- **Strategy**: Incremental integration with validation at each step
- **Priority**: Critical system scripts first, then development tools
- **Safety**: All changes tracked in Git with rollback capability
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before committing changes

## Quick Reference

### Key Locations
- Dotfiles repo: `~/.dotfiles` (bare repository)
- Configuration: `~/.config/` (XDG_CONFIG_HOME)
- User scripts: `~/.local/bin/` (XDG_BIN_HOME)
- Memory bank: `~/memory-bank/` (this documentation)

### Key Commands
- Dotfiles management: `dot status`, `dot add`, `dot commit`
- UV tool sync: `uv tool sync` (recreates symlinks)
- Memory bank: Access via Basic Memory MCP tools

### Performance Targets
- Shell startup: < 500ms
- No noticeable command execution lag
- Minimal resource usage for background processes

## Integration Timeline

### Completed (‚úÖ)
- **Step 1**: Current State Assessment
- **Step 2**: Script Inventory and Classification (in progress)
- **Step 3**: Documentation Foundation

### Next Steps (üîÑ)
- **Step 4**: High-Priority Script Integration
  - Critical: Script audit and backup (T4.1, T4.2)
  - High: Dotfiles and system script integration (T4.3, T4.4)
  - Medium: Shell configuration updates (T4.5, T4.6)

### Future Steps (üü°)
- **Step 5**: Development Tool Scripts
- **Step 6**: Configuration Harmonization  
- **Step 7**: VS Code Integration Update
- **Step 8-10**: Testing, Documentation, Deployment

## Risk Management

### High Risk Areas
- Dotfiles management scripts (could break repository operations)
- System automation scripts (could affect macOS automation)
- Shell configuration changes (could break terminal functionality)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Git-based backup and rollback capability
- Incremental integration with testing at each step
- Comprehensive documentation of all changes
- Validation of core functionality before proceeding

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All existing script functionality preserved
- [ ] XDG Base Directory compliance maintained
- [ ] Shell startup performance not degraded
- [ ] Development workflow continuity ensured

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation updated
- [ ] All changes committed to Git repository
- [ ] Integration decisions clearly recorded
- [ ] Rollback procedures validated

## Next Actions

Based on the current documentation state, the immediate next steps are:

1. **Begin Step 4 execution** following the task breakdown
2. **Start with T4.1** (Script Inventory Audit) as the critical first task
3. **Create backup** (T4.2) before making any changes
4. **Proceed incrementally** through high-priority script integration

## Documentation Maintenance

This memory bank should be updated:
- After completion of each major task
- When technical decisions are made or changed
- At the end of each integration step
- When issues or learnings emerge during integration

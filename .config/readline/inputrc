# inputrc is the config for GNU Readline. Anything that uses Readline
# benefits from these configs (in case you're wondering why they aren't
# in .bashrc).
# From http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2003/papers/bash_tips/

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)

We will follow this process:\n\n1. Your first response will be to ask me what the design project should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.\n\n2. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections:\n   a) Revised Prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you)\n   b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt)\n\n3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section until I say we are done.\n‍\nThroughout this process, consider the following to enhance the prompt:\n- Clarity and specificity of the design brief\n- Target audience and brand personality\n- Key visual elements or style references\n- Color preferences or restrictions\n- Any technical requirements or limitations\n- Project timeline and deliverables\nRemember to ask about the broader context of the design project, such as its place in a larger marketing campaign or brand strategy.\n\nAfter we've refined the prompt, please provide a brief explanation of how this detailed prompt can lead to more effective design outcomes and streamline the creative process.”",
